Knowledge of the movement patterns of individuals can help give an understanding of where, 
when and how they move and can hold valuable information about their habits over the course of their lifetime. 
Towards building such a knowledge base, we undertook a project whose goal was estimating the location of individuals 
in remote areas. For this, we have employed smoothing algorithms to de-noise RSSI data, multilateration techniques 
to estimate the coordinates of individuals and have made use of the Google Maps API for visualising the results.
